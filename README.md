# hello-world
This is my introduction to programming.  Hopefully, I'm successful in my learning endeavors.  

I've been in the IT industry for 20+ years as a system administrator.  Before that, I was a Bio-medical technician performing maintenance and repair on all forms of medical equipment from automatic blood pressure cuffs to laboratory analysers.  Before my biomedical years, I was in the U.S. Army providing component level repair of electronic cryptography equipment.
